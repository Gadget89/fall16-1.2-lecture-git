# 1.2 Warmup

## Why Focus on Terminal?
Please explain why we use Terminal when we could just point and click like everyday people!

You could talk about the benefits to:
  - Others on your development team
  - Using remote servers
  - Speed of creating & manipulating of files
  - Anything else you can think of...

I would like to see 2-3 paragraphs. Direct message me a "snippet" on Slack when you're finished.

You have until 9:15am.
